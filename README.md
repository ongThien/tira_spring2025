# Tira 2025 – Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains my Python solutions to the exercises from the **Data Structures and Algorithms, spring 2025** course.

## Course Info

- **Disclaimer**: The deadline for this course has ended but we all still benefit from the knowledge, just without the certificate and ECTs credits for the course.
- **Course**: [Spring 2025 – Data Structures and Algorithms](https://tira.mooc.fi/spring-2025/)
- **Exercise Set**: [cses.fi/dsa25k/list](https://cses.fi/dsa25k/list/)

## Structure

Each week will have its own folder, mirroring the structure of the course and containing individual `.py` files for each exercise.

Happy coding!
